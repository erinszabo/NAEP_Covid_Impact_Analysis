-- docker build -t mysql_db .

-- docker run -d mysql_db
-- ^^ -d detached so that it doesn't take up the terminal. remove this to troubleshoot 

 then list the containers so I can get the <containerID>
-- docker container ls

--------- to jump straight to sql:
docker exec -it <containerID> mysql -u root -proot

----------- to jump into linux first:
-- docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash

 now should be running inside container, now you can cd into the dir created in the dockerfile 
   and now we can access mysql:

-- cd docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
-- mysql -proot

review:
-- use surveyDB;
-- show tables;
-- SELECT * from  <tablename>;


-- SELECT * FROM math_no_missing
   ORDER BY Avg_score DESC;

-- Ctrl-D to exit mySQL

-------------------------------- current work:---------------------------------------------------
  Analyze the data, see what patterns I can find.
From here I want to start incorporating python, pandas, and matplotlib to work with and visualize the data.
I'd like to see which questions seemed to reveal the biggest varience in scores, ie. which resources have 
the greatest impact for these 9th graders.

------------ TODO:
1- make a base python file, connect to the database
2- use docker-compose for setup and to run python once sql files are finished
3- discovery: now work on the python file, organize data and use matplotlip to visualize. This step will 
  take some time and fiddling to see what patterns I can find.
4- demonstrate: show what I've found by saving plots as images and creating an MD file to display those
  images and describe the information gleamed from them. Keep this file brief.
5- write a README.md file to describe setup and them describe results from the project. In the results
  section of this file, reference the file created in the last step and give a more in depth description
  description of what I did and what the graphs mean. If I want to include images in the README, let
  them exist in the folder permanently to be referenced without needing to run the program so someone 
  can get the gist without running it and understand that running the project will generate the reference 
  file.
