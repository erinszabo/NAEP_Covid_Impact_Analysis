-- docker build -t mysql_db .

-- docker run -d mysql_db
-- ^^ -d so that it doesn't take up the terminal. remove this to troubleshoot 

 then list the containers so I can get the <containerID>
-- docker container ls

-- docker exec -it <containerID> /bin/bash

 now should be running inside container, now you can cd into the dir created in the dockerfile 
   and now we can access mysql:

-- cd docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
-- mysql -proot
----------------------------------- SQL -----------------------------------------------------------
-- now we can show databases and see that the database in the sql file was created.

-- use surveyDB;
-- show tables;
-- ^^ now we can see the tables in the database


-- SELECT * from  <tablename>
-^ do this with math and reading tables to check that they were created and populated correctly




-------------------------------- current work:---------------------------------------------------

Interpreting the tables (atarting with the math table):

PCT SE  -  I believe this is percent standard error. This gives an idea of the level of confidence in their
    measurement, so it isn't a value I have interest in working with. All of the values are low enough
    to have relativly high confidence in the data accurecy so I dont think I will use this to weed out 
    uninformative results, so I think I should just remove the column completely. Or not include then in 
    a bare bones version of the table.

Score SE  -  Unfortunetly, some of the stardard error values in this column are higher, so I may want to
    take this into consideration. For now, I think I will ignore them and hope that the data is good enough
    to work with. I will not incluse this in my bare bones table.

Survey questions  -  I temporarily removed the survey questions just to work through loading the tables
    and getting that all to work correctly without dealing with the commas, though I regret this because they
    are integral to the information I'm looking at, so I want to put them back.

Flag  -  I removed the flag because I am not finding information on it's significance. 


Category  -  I'm not finding information on this online, but I am noticing some patterns just looking at the
    tables, there is some consistency with the category number and the answer provided to a question.
    I want to use SQL to look at these patterns by creating subtables that contain only rows of a certain
    category.

------------ TODO:
  1- add the survey questions back into the tables/csv files.
  2- look at patterns to learn significance of categories using sql.
